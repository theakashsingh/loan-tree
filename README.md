## üèóÔ∏è Data Model

### Tree Structure Shape

The application uses a hierarchical tree structure where:

```
Account (Root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Loan
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Collateral
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Loan (Sub-loan)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Collateral
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Loan
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Collateral
```

### Node Schema

Each node in the tree contains:

```typescript
interface TreeNode {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier (format: id-{random})
  type: 'account' | 'loan' | 'collateral';
  children?: TreeNode[];
  parentId?: string;
  // Additional metadata based on node type
}
```

### Relationship Rules

1. **Account**: Root level nodes representing customer accounts
2. **Loan**: Can be children of Accounts or other Loans (sub-loans)
3. **Collateral**: Can only be children of Loans

## üé® Node Types

### Account Node
- **Icon**: Blue folder icon
- **Purpose**: Represents a customer's account
- **Children**: Can have multiple Loans
- **Visual**: Blue background with account ID

### Loan Node  
- **Icon**: Green circle with minus icon
- **Purpose**: Represents individual loans
- **Children**: Can have Collateral and sub-Loans
- **Visual**: Green background with loan ID

### Collateral Node
- **Icon**: Orange circle with "C" icon
- **Purpose**: Represents collateral tied to loans
- **Children**: Leaf nodes (no children allowed)
- **Visual**: Orange background with collateral ID

## üéØ UX Design Decisions

### Side Panel Layout
- **Right-side positioning**: Keeps tree view unobstructed
- **Contextual information**: Shows selected node details
- **Action-oriented**: Primary actions (Add Child, Delete) prominently displayed
- **Clean separation**: Clear visual distinction between tree and details

### Add/Delete Flow
- **Add Child Nodes**: 
  - Click on any node to select it
  - Use "Add Child Node" section in side panel
  - Type-specific buttons (Add Loan, Add Collateral) based on parent type
  - Immediate visual feedback with tree re-layout

- **Delete Nodes**:
  - Select target node
  - Red "Delete Node" button in Actions section
  - Confirmation message warns about cascading deletion
  - Maintains tree integrity by removing all descendants

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Color coding**: Distinct colors for each node type aid quick identification
- **Indentation**: Clear parent-child relationships through visual nesting
- **Icons**: Consistent iconography for immediate type recognition
- **Interactive feedback**: Hover states and selection highlighting

### Navigation & Usability
- **Single-click selection**: Simple interaction model
- **Expandable nodes**: Collapsible tree sections for large structures
- **Child count indicators**: Shows number of children per node
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theakashsingh/loan-tree.git
   cd loan-tree
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **View Tree Structure**: The main canvas displays your loan hierarchy
2. **Select Nodes**: Click on any node to view details in the side panel
3. **Add Nodes**: Use the "Add Child Node" section to create new nodes
4. **Delete Nodes**: Select a node and use the delete button in Actions
5. **Export Data**: Use the "View JSON" button to see the raw data structure

### Node Management

- **Adding Accounts**: Use the "+ Account" button in the top toolbar
- **Adding Loans**: Select an Account or Loan, then click "Add Loan"
- **Adding Collateral**: Select a Loan, then click "Add Collateral"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Trade-offs

### Current Limitations

1. **Data Persistence**: 
   - No backend integration
   - Data is lost on page refresh
   - Manual JSON export/import required

2. **Scalability**:
   - Large trees (>100 nodes) may impact performance
   - No virtualization for massive datasets
   - Memory usage grows with tree size

3. **Validation**:
   - Limited business rule enforcement
   - No loan amount or collateral value validation
   - Basic node relationship constraints only

4. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Side panel may be cramped on small screens
   - Touch interactions not optimized
   - Pan/zoom gestures could be improved

### Technical Trade-offs

1. **Client-Side Only**:
   - **Pro**: Simple deployment, no server costs
   - **Con**: No data persistence, limited scalability

2. **ReactFlow Dependency**:
   - **Pro**: Rich interaction features, good performance
   - **Con**: Large bundle size, learning curve

3. **Auto-layout Algorithm**:
   - **Pro**: Consistent, professional tree layout
   - **Con**: Less control over manual positioning

4. **Redux for Simple State**:
   - **Pro**: Predictable state management, debugging tools
   - **Con**: Overkill for current complexity level

### Future Improvements

- Backend integration for data persistence
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Loan amount and financial calculations
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, Excel)
- Collaborative editing features
- Mobile-responsive optimizations
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
